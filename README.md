README
===================

Ruby version is 4.1.1

This file creates an app that lets you add, edit, and update schools you've attended and life events you have had.

The file has been saved as a GitHub project called "life_tracker" and posted [here](https://basecamp.com/1940253/projects/6016749/messages/27170808).

To create a record, enter school or life event name, beginning year, and ending year.
Save the record.

To edit a record, click on the record, make the appropriate edits, and save the record.

To delete the record, click on the recond and then click the button labeled "destroy."

To exit the app, close the browser window.


The assignment bonus was to create a new controller called HomeController that shows one view on the root of the site and links to your schools and life events.
